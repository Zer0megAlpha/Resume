    <h1>Hi, I'm Vladislav Yourtchenko. </h1>

    <p>I'm a student at DePaul University studying to be a Software Engineer.</p>

    <p>My passions are in developing quirky side projects and exploring entrepreneurship.</p>

    <p>I'm a big fan of eastern philosophy. I also practice meditation for the mindfulness and discipline it builds.</p>
